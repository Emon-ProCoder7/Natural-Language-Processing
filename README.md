## 01. Discovering Insights from Homer's Iliad with NLP

  Novels and text contain insights into ideologies and places that are often originally unknown to the reader. By reading a written piece, we uncover the opinions of the author on their chosen topic and come to understand both the topic and how the author thinks.

In this project I've performed a natural language parsing analysis to gain deeper insight into [Homer’s The Iliad!](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6130). Here is my ➡[Text File](the_iliad.txt) of that novel. 

One of the beauties of natural language parsing with regular expressions is the ability to gain insight into lengthy pieces of text without a formal read! 
  
### Project Goals:
  - Finding out the main topics of discussion in the novel and can begin to discern some of the author’s thoughts and beliefs 
  ***"Without Actually Reading The Novel"!*** ▶

## 01. Who sent The Letter?

  I’ve received an anonymous postcard from a friend who I haven’t seen in years. My friend did not leave a name, but the card is definitely addressed to me. So far, I’ve narrowed my search down to three friends, based on handwriting:

- Alexandra Daddario
- Benedict Cumberbatch
- Jennifer Lawrence 

I have all the past writings from each friend saved as text here: [Alexandra Daddario](Alexandra_Daddario_raw.py),  [Benedict Cumberbatch](Benedict_Cumberbatch_raw.py), [Jennifer Lawrence](Jennifer_Lawrence_raw.py)
  
### Project Goals:

  - But which one sent the card?
