# **HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH SCIPY**   


  
## 01. Sample Size Determination

  Sample size determination for, Nosh Mish Mosh, a recipe and ingredient meal delivery service. They ship the raw materials and people get to cook it at their home! These rainbow fingerling potatoes don‚Äôt come cheap. They‚Äôd like to know for sure that they‚Äôll be pulling in at least $1240 more every week. In order to make product and interface A/B testing decisions to grab more customers, here survey sample size determination is needed for decision making.
  
### Project Goals:
  - Baseline Conversion Rate.
  - Lift
  - Statistical Significance at 90%
  - What amount of customers need to be surveyed.
