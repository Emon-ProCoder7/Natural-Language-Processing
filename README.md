## 01. Discovering Insights from Homer's Iliad with NLP

  Novels and text contain insights into ideologies and places that are often originally unknown to the reader. By reading a written piece, we uncover the opinions of the author on their chosen topic and come to understand both the topic and how the author thinks.

In this project I've performed a natural language parsing analysis to gain deeper insight into [Homer’s The Iliad!](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6130). Here is my [Text File](the_iliad.txt) of that novel. 

One of the beauties of natural language parsing with regular expressions is the ability to gain insight into lengthy pieces of text without a formal read! 
  
### Project Goals:
  - Finding out the main topics of discussion in the novel and can begin to discern some of the author’s thoughts and beliefs 
  ***"Without Actually Reading The Novel"!***
